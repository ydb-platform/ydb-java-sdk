## 1.14.4 ##

* Added support of not null columns in TableDescription

## 1.14.3 ##

* Added request's costInfo to all operations

## 1.14.2 ##

* Remove use common FJ

## 1.14.1 ##

## 1.14.0 ##

* Bind session to server node it was created at

## 1.13.8 ##

* Added support of changefeeds to alterTable

## 1.13.7 ##

* Added regular re-discovery for new YDB transport implementation
* Added node pessimization on receiving transport error in new YDB transport implementation

## 1.13.6 ##

* Added reportCostInfo flag to RequestSettings
* Added costInfo to DataQueryResult

## 1.13.5 ##

* Use cached version of IAM Auth Provider

## 1.13.4 ##

* Fix some issues in session pool

## 1.13.3 ##

* Added QueryStatsCollection.Mode parameter to ExecuteDataQuerySettings

## 1.13.2 ##

* Use TableDescription.getPartitioningSettings() by default, mark CreateTableSettings.getPartitioningSettings() deprected

## 1.13.1 ##

* Added data columns (for covered indexes) to TableDescription

## 1.13.0 ##

* Upgrade to use java-grpc 1.43.2

## 1.12.2 ##

* PreferNearestLoadBalancer and RandomChoiceLoadBalancer merged to YdbLoadBalancer
* Fixed problems with java-grpc > 1.26.x

## 1.12.1 ##

* Fixed PreferNearestLoadBalancer

## 1.12.0 ##

* Added YDB transport implementation (YDB_TRANSPORT_IMPL). Grpc transport implementation (GRPC_TRANSPORT_IMPL) is still used by default.
New transport implementation doesnt have noticable advantages over grpc implementation yet. But it makes room for some further improvements.

## 1.11.6 ##

* Removed internal proto files

## 1.11.5 ##

* Added module protobuf-api with proto files

## 1.11.4 ##

* Fix grpc-netty-shaded dependency

## 1.11.3 ##

* Removed double byte copy for getString(Charset charset)
* Added termination waiting for GrpcTransport

## 1.11.2 ##

* Fixed Netty TLS on JDK8 builds

## 1.11.1 ##

* Additional timing logs for Session

## 1.11.0 ##

* Added minPartitionsCount and maxPartitionsCount to PartitioningSettings
* Added PartitioningSettings and PartitionStats to describeTable result

## 1.10.11 ##

* Fix unwrapped CompletionException for getOrCreateSession

## 1.10.10 ##

* Fix retries counter in SessionRetryContext

## 1.10.9 ##

* Extended logging for Session and SessionRetryContext

## 1.10.8 ##

* Add URL Shortener demo application

## 1.10.7 ##

* Reuse HashedWheelTimer in GrpcOperationTray

## 1.10.6 ##

* Add JUnit tests with testcontainer support
* Add bulk upsert example

## 1.10.5 ##

* Lowered logging level for some messages.

## 1.10.4 ##

* Discovery host resolve check was softened. Now at least 1/2 resolved hosts of all that discovery returned is considered as a success resolve. This prevents from failing requests when some hosts can not be resolved.

## 1.10.3 ##

* Added logging for locks in session pool.

## 1.10.2 ##

* Added idempotent flag for SessionRetryContext which mark an operation as retryable.

## 1.10.1 ##

* Added public method tryToConnect() for GrpcTransport allowing to add any logic in case of connection timeout or other errors.

## 1.10.0 ##

* Added DiscoveryMode for GrpcTransport. SYNC mode is used by default, which means GRPCTransport will lock on constructor until grpc channel will be connected. This should improve session balancing on start with high load. It should also reduce latency of first requests.

## 1.9.3 ##

* Fix String comparsion in CloudAuthHelper.

## 1.9.2 ##

* Endpoint re-discovery now launches periodically as intended.

## 1.9.1 ##

* All timers are now stopped on shutdown so the application should stop immediately.

## 1.9.0 ##

* Added Random choice load balancer which is now used by default instead of round robin load balancer.

## 1.8.4 ##

* Use a bit more modern GRPC name resolver factory API to facilitate GRPC implementation upgrades downstream.

## 1.8.3 ##

* Added connection string support.

## 1.8.2 ##

* Added CloudAuthProvider for cloud authentication with environment variables.

## 1.8.1 ##

* Added AlterLogTable to ydb_logstore_v1.proto.

## 1.8.0 ##

* Added fast backoff settings to SessionRetryContext. ABORTED and UNAVAILABLE status codes are retried with fast backoff now.

## 1.7.10 ##

* Update junit from 4.12 to 4.13.1.
* Update protobuf from 3.6.1 to 4.15.6.

## 1.7.9 ##

* Disabling client query cache does not disable server-side query cache anymore.

## 1.7.8 ##
